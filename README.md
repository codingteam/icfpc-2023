How to Develop

See https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/fsharp/tools for the main options.

Fee free to use editor of choice, but the easiest tools to get started are:

- Visual Studio (Windows-only)
  - Community Edition is free and should be okay for this project
  - Open `Infpc2023.sln` and then press the **Run** button

- Visual Studio Code with Ionide extension (cross-platform)
  - Totally free
  - Open the solution folder (the one with the `.sln` file), install the Ionide extension, and then use the **Run and Debug** tool window to execute the project

- JetBrains Rider (cross-platform)
  - Commercial
  - Free EAP and trial builds are available and are okay to use for this project (I, @ForNeVeR, use EAP myself)
  - Open the `.sln` file and then hit the green **Run** button to get started

Other viable options are [Vim](https://github.com/ionide/Ionide-vim), [Emacs](https://github.com/fsharp/emacs-fsharp-mode), and any editor with LSP support via [FsAutoComplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete).
